This is my personal webpage project, and also a chance to mess around with a static web page generator.

For my webpage I chose [Statik][statik-website] as my go-to framework, which uses [Jinja2][jinja-website] as their template engine and 
[SQLAlchemy][sqlalchemy-website] for their database.

The main purpose for this project is to display my information in a presentable manner and, over time, expand it with my other personal 
projects and maybe a blog post or two.

This project also serves as a way to prepare a seminar and, possibly, give a talk about it.
